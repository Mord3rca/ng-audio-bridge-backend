# ng-audio-bridge-backend
The backend of [NG Audio Bridge](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/553053 ).

## Network Modification

* You need to be an administrator to do this modification.

To use it on your machine, you have to add the following lines to your `/etc/hosts` :
```
127.0.0.1	gumonshoe.net
127.0.0.1	www.gumonshoe.net
```

Host file path are:

For GNU/Linux: `/etc/hosts`

For MacOS: `/private/etc/hosts`

For Windows: `%WINDIR%\\System32\\Drivers\\etc\\hosts`

## Functionality

* All Song are now indexed (update will be done weekly)

* Fully Compatible with [NG Audio Bridge](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/553053)

## Futur Improvement

Mostly for the crawler, I want to upgrade the indexing DB to allow more precise search.

Will be compatible with my other project: [Newgrounds Radio](https://github.com/Mord3rca/newgrounds-radio)
